The transcript features at least 8 back and forths with 3 people, casual techie talk, and conversational fillers ('um', 'you know', 'kinda'). The poor quality is shown by incomplete sentences, repeated info, and vague references causing some confusion. This mimics real-world low-quality automatic transcripts of standups, increasing difficulty in summarization.","[info] Standup time: 04/10/2024 09:15:00

Alice: Um, hey folks, so... uh, the payment integration, it's like kinda almost done? I think?
Bob: Yeah, payment's uh, pending some... API glitches, you know, that, uh... thing with the token refresh.
Charlie: Uh, backend server crashed yesterday. Not sure if that's uh, connected but gonna check.
Alice: Right, right, forgot to mention, um, the UI fixes were delayed. Some... issues with the color scheme.
Bob: Also, um, the doc updates are, kind of half-done? Still working on 'em.
Charlie: Uh, do we have the, uh... deadline again? Was it 04/15?
Alice: Yeah, but might slip, um, because of these blockers.
Bob: Also got some... uh, merge conflicts in the main branch this morning.
Alice: So, yeah... um, we’re like, behind, but will try to catch up.
Charlie: Okay, well, I’ll ping the infra team about the server...

",Payment Integration,04/15/2024,At Risk,"- Payment integration nearly done but blocked by API token issues
- Backend server crash under investigation
- UI fixes delayed due to color scheme problems
- Documentation partially complete
- Merge conflicts causing delays
- Deadline likely to slip","The payment integration project is close to completion but currently blocked by API token refresh glitches. The backend server crash adds uncertainty, while UI fixes have been delayed due to color scheme issues. Documentation is only partially done, and merge conflicts have further slowed progress. As a result, the April 15 deadline is now at risk."
6. Bad transcript quality,"The new test case should replicate a realistic standup meeting among software engineers, keeping the casual tone and informal speech patterns, including ums and partial sentences. However, since the focus is on bad transcript quality, the transcript will contain misspellings, unclear phrases, overlapping sentences, and occasional inaudible parts marked as [inaudible]. The transcript will have at least 8 back and forths among at least 3 speakers, following the style of the given example. This will test the prompt's robustness when processing noisy input to generate coherent summaries and status extraction.","[info] Standup time: 10/05/2024 09:15:00

Liam: Uh, hey, so, uh, I started working on the new payment inter- uh, integration... but um, ran into some issues with the API auth, I think?
Maya: Yeah, I saw that, the uh, tokens, they, um, expire before the re- refresh? So, it's causing failures.
Liam: Exactly, um, need to check with backend team, uh, Pranav, are you around?
Pranav: Yeah, kinda busy, but I think the token expiry was changed last sprint, maybe you missed the update?
Maya: Oh, yeah, I didn’t get that memo, thanks.
Liam: Okay, so, uh, will sync up after this. Also, um, deployment for the release, is it still on track?
Pranav: Hmm, not sure, the last build failed [inaudible]. Need to fix failing tests first.
Maya: I'm still finishing up the user profile UI tweaks, should be ready by tomorrow.
Liam: Great. Uh, what about QA? Any blockers?
QA Sam: Uh, yeah, there is a regression in checkout flow, uh, M- Maya’s changes might be related.
Maya: Hm, okay, I’ll look into that immediately.
Liam: Cool. Um, so target date for release?
Pranav: It's scheduled for 10/10/2024 but with these issues, could slip.
Liam: Alright, let's keep pressure on fixes then.",payment integration,10/10/2024,At Risk,"- Payment integration hitting API auth token expiry issues
- Backend changes to token expiry missed by frontend
- Build failures blocking deployment
- Regression found in checkout flow affecting QA
- User profile UI tweaks ongoing
- Release target date 10/10/2024 may slip due to current issues","The team is working on the payment integration project but encountering issues with API authentication tokens expiring earlier than expected, which was a backend change not communicated to frontend developers. The latest build has failing tests that block deployment. QA has found a regression in the checkout flow potentially related to recent UI changes. Although UI tweaks are still being finished, these factors put the scheduled release for October 10 at risk. The team plans to prioritize fixing these blockers to stay on schedule."
6. Bad transcript quality,"To create a bad quality transcript reflecting real-world noise and speech artifacts common in remote or rushed standups, I will add overlapping dialogue, filler words, incomplete sentences, unclear references, and some minor transcription errors. This aligns with the casual style and multiple speakers demonstrated in the example. The transcript will contain at least 8 exchanges and 3 participants, but the overall clarity will be lower to test robustness of summarization.","[info] Standup time: 10/04/2024 09:15:00

Ava: Uhm, yeah hello! So, I think, um, we are mostly done with the UI revamp, right? Not sure if backend – oh wait, did you push the latest API, Liam?

Liam: Uh, yeah I tried, but well, got some errors, uh, like the, uh, auth token thingy, so it’s not fully up yet - sorry.

Maya: I was checking yesterday, the, um, login flow crashes sometimes - I guess it's related? Maybe the session expiration?

Ava: Oh, okay, yeah that might be. Um, I think, wait, are we still on track for the, uh, October 15th rollout?

Liam: Honestly, um, with these issues, it seems tight. We might miss it.

Maya: Yeah, also, uh, some feedback from QA wasn't clear? Like, they said 'needs more testing' but didn't specify what exactly.

Ava: Right, we, uh, should get that clarified. Okay, so, um, let's try to fix the API and maybe push the fixes soon.

Liam: Got it, I'll keep working on the backend, um, but might need help with those errors.

Maya: And I'll, um, try to reproduce the crash and get better bug details.

Ava: Perfect, thanks guys, um, let's sync more tomorrow.",UI Revamp,10/15/2024,At Risk,"- UI revamp mostly done on frontend

- Login flow crashes possibly due to session expiration
- Unclear QA feedback needing clarification
- Rollout by 10/15/2024 now at risk
- Team planning to fix API and crash bugs urgently","The UI revamp project is mostly complete on the frontend but backend API issues are causing authentication errors, leading to intermittent login crashes. QA feedback is vague, making it hard to prioritize tests. These problems threaten the planned rollout on October 15, 2024.
